            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If Chriſt knocke let him not ſtay, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is that fire, which is able to ſoften thy heart, though hard as iron, or impenetrable as the ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and make it, like melting waxe in the midſt of thy bowels. He alone, is that bread, which is able to fill thy heart, the ſeuerall Angels of that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Trigonum,</hi> with the immenſitie of his preſence. O let him not ſtand onely in thy forehead by ſhow, and profeſſion: but call him into thy heart, by faith, and prayer, and deuout acknowledgement, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inuocation; elſe are ye like thoſe that go into the Sunne, not for heate, or warmth, but to be ſeene, and to be admired: ſhall he cry to theſe, <hi>Vulneraſti cor meum,</hi> thou haſt wounded my heart, thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes; and wilt not thou make anſwer, <hi>Paratum eſt cor meum,</hi> my heart is readie, ô God, my heart is ready? O the true <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and beloued of his Father, this is that deare, and onely beloued ſonne, which he will haue thee offer. Almes, mercie, repentance, charitie, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, propheſie, contrition, humiliation, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we can performe without a heart, is but as an offering without ſalt, and makes but an hatefull and prodigious ſacrifice. If the Pſalmiſts reioyce, it is in the innocencie of heart. If the Apoſtle exhort, it is to ſimplicitie of heart. If the Lord be pleaſed, it is with vprightneſſe of heart. If the Law be ended, and the Goſpell eſtabliſhed, it is in loue, from a pure heart and a good conſcience. <hi>The end of the Law is loue, from a pure heart, and a good conſcience, and faith vnfained.</hi> I remember God charged the Prieſt to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19972:13"/> ſanctifie the <hi>breaſt of their ſhake offering,</hi> as well as <hi>the ſhoulder of the heaue offering.</hi> That we might ſee, it is not ſo much the outward man, as the inward, wherein he delighteth, neither is it enough to beare Chriſt in the head, as <hi>Minerua</hi> did <hi>Iupiter,</hi> vnleſſe we beare him in the heart, as <hi>Mary</hi> did our Sauiour. <hi>Grauidare potuit, grauare non potuit beatam virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> He might well fill her wombe with the glorie of his fleſh, he could not burden her, with trouble of his preſence: How then will they ſatisfie this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that haue no heart vnto goodneſſe? The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <hi>Philopoemen</hi> is likened vnto a man, that hath legs &amp; feete, but no belly: becauſe they wanted money, which is the heart of warre: ſo I feare in the Church militant, there be diuerſe that haue legs, and feete, but no bellie: they haue the legges and the feete of outward conuerſation, but they want the heart and the belly of inward deuotion. <hi>Non vitae ſed famae negotiatores,</hi> (as <hi>Tertul.</hi> makes the charachter) ſuch as negotiate and trade more for a good name, then for a good life: for a good report, then a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If the Lord will be on the eare, who ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to attend his word, and to call for a Sermon? If the Lord will be on the tongue, who ſo forward to confeſſe his name, or to ſpeake of Religion, till they haue turned <hi>Sacramentum in ſermonem,</hi> (as <hi>Saluianus</hi> ſpeakes) the ſacred vſe, of his glorious name, into vaine babling, and the fooliſh contention of words and trifles. But let him call for the heart, they are quite blanke, either it is loſteth the cares of this world, or ſold to worke deceit and wickedneſſe. Thus haue they a ſhew of godlineſſe, but denie the power thereof, like fidlers, that are more carefull in tuning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19972:13"/> their inſtruments, then in tuning their liues: their tongues are their inſtruments, if they be in tune, and the ſtrings thereof well ſet, to faire language and glozing hypocriſie, all is well: they haue done their parts, and dutie, I know not whether I may ſay they haue no heart, or a double heart, <gap reason="foreign">

They are not many hearts, but one, that he deſireth, howbeit the conditions thereof be diuerſe. For it muſt be a new heart, and a cleane heart, &amp; a ſound heart, and a broken heart, renewed by his word, clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his bloud, ſound by the truth of doctrine, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the contrition of ſpirit, elſe will he forſake the tabernacle of our body, and abhorre both heart and arme, which is the ſecond receptacle of our Sauiour.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For though Loue precede Faith in order of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet Faith precedes Loue in order of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; did the Prophet begin to ſpeake before the heart waxt hot, and the fire was kindled in his breaſt? Firſt beleeue with thy heart, then confeſſe with thy mouth, yet ſo that heart, and mouth, and hand, and arme, may go together. Good workes ioyned to Faith, are as a ſtrong building on a good foundation: the building of gold, and ſiluer, vpon that ground which is laid of old, I meane Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>Mary</hi> had no ſooner borne Chriſt in her wombe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19972:14"/> and preſented him in the Temple, but <hi>Simeon</hi> takes him in his armes, and embraceth him ioyfully. For we muſt not be aſhamed of our profeſſion, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the enſigne of our Sauiour openly before vs, that ſo the vertue, and the patience, and the meekneſſe, and the obedience of Chriſt Ieſus, may be found in euery part; but chiefly in our actions. Chriſt on the heart, is like ſeed on the earth: Chriſt on the arme, is like corne on the eare. Chriſt on the heart, like a tree planted by the riuers of water: Chriſt on the arme, like a tree bringing fruit in time of Autumne, and therefore true Religion, and vndefiled before God, is practicall, and operatiue, in the workes of mercie: <hi>To viſit the fatherleſſe, and widowes in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: and to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world.</hi> If our lips drop hony, by the preaching of his word, and the ſweetneſſe of his doctrine it is good and commendable, but if our hands drop myrh, by the crucifying of him, and the mortification of our earthly members by the obedience of Chriſt, and the perfect imitation of Chriſtian holineſſe, it is moſt comfortable and heauenly. There be that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the paths of Chriſt, and (to vſe the words of <hi>Saluianus) Patentiora faciunt Domini veſtigia,</hi> they make the footſteps of our Sauiour more plaine and eaſie, by the example of their vertue, and the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their bountie. Theſe be they which beare him in their armes, and carrie him as a lampe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their hands for the benefit of others. <hi>Do men gather figs of thornes, or grapes of thiſtles? Ye ſhall know them by their fruite.</hi> And as Chriſt ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>interrogate opera,</hi> aske my workes, for they ſpeake of me: ſo may we ſay of them, <hi>interrogate</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:19972:14"/> 
                     <hi>opera,</hi> aske their workes, for they ſpeake of them, looke not on the face, regard not the voice, they may haue the voice of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but the hands of <hi>Eſau:</hi> enquire of their workes, they beare witneſſe of them, and are the ſureſt markes of euery Chriſtian. <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum videtur</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> A good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher is beſt heard, when hee is ſeene; and a true Chriſtian beſt knowne, by the glaſſe of his life, and the preſident of his actions. It is a good reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that ancient Father vſed in his Moralls. <hi>Alis feriunt, vbi opera ostendunt.</hi> The works of the Saints, are as the wings of the Cherubins that touch one another: for as they ſmite one another by their wings: ſo we excite one another by our workes, and prouoke (as it were) to godlineſſe of liuing, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then (I beſeech you) the end of your vocation, that ye are the workmanſhip of God, created in Chriſt Ieſus to good workes: That he gaue his life for you, to the end you might be a peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, zealous of good workes: die vnto ſinne, liue vnto righteouſneſſe, caſt of the workes of darkneſſe, put on the armour of light, that ye may be worthy of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and the doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in all things may be honoured. Ye are they, of whom the Apoſtle doth trauell in birth, that Chriſt may be formed in you, and you transformed into him, as well in arme as in heart, as well in body as in ſpirit. O let it neuer be ſaid of theſe bleſſed armes, the armes of your workes, as <hi>Milo</hi> ſaid of his armes, the armes of his fleſh, <hi>Hi mortui ſunt,</hi> they are dead, and there is no life in them. But let the power, and the courage, and the vigour, and the Spirit of Chriſt Ieſus, quicken and make ye vigeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19972:15"/> in all goodneſſe. Anatomiſts do obſerue, there is a veine runnes from the heart to the arme, and bounds on the finger, where the ring is worne, if Chriſt be our ring and ſeale, he muſt be ſo on the arme, that he leaue not the heart, ſo on the heart, that he reach vnto the arme, for direction of faith and manners. Here might I call heauen and earth to record, and witneſſe before God and his Angels, how iniuriouſly we are traduced, to deſpiſe the Law, and not to care for the decalogue, to rely vpon a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked faith, without the fruite of holineſſe, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of his precepts. Oh thou which bindeſt thy words, as ſignes vpon our armes, and as front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets betweene our eyes, pleade our cauſe, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate vs from this calumnie: tell theſe men, thou art not onely as a ſeale vpon our hearts, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy truth, but as a ſignet vpon our armes, by the conformitie of life, and the exerciſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſo I haſten to the ſeale, and cloſure of diſcourſe: which is the forme and ſemblance, and that is <hi>a ſeale or a ſignet.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Put me as a ſeale, and a ſignet.</hi> Well may hee be tearmed a ſeale, that is, the brightneſſe of his Fathers glorie, and the engrauen forme of his ſubſtance, but that which is here a ſeale or a ſignet, is onely <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Originall. A ring, or a ſeale, that as we haue borne the image of the earthly, ſo we may beare the image of the heauenly, by ſimilitude and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to our Sauiour: whether in his obedience and his righteouſneſſe, or in his patience and his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. For as no ſiluer is currant, vnleſſe it beare the image &amp; ſuperſcription of the Emperour: ſo there is nothing auaileable before God, without the ſtamp
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19972:15"/> of his Sonne, and the character of our Sauiour. Thoughts, vowes, meditations, prayers, intentions, actions, are but vaine and friuolous, and will neuer be able to purchaſe heauen, vnleſſe they be ſealed in Chriſt, and the aſſurance of his mercie: in whom all the promiſes of God, are yea and Amen.</p>
                  <p>This made the Church in her Liturgie, ſeale vp her petitions in the name and mediation of Chriſt Ieſus: in all her ſupplications, and interceſſions, ſhe doth adiure God, and bind him (as it were) by this ſeale, <hi>Per Ieſum Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum,</hi> Through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, through Ieſus Chriſt our onely mediator and redeemer. I will not draw my Text to the Croſſe in Baptiſme, becauſe it is not ſaid, he will be a ſeale, but as a ſeale, and there is a good meaning of that in Saint <hi>Auſtin, Deus amat ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum ſuorum factores, non pictores:</hi> Yet let me tell the turbulent Schiſmaticke, and factious Noualiſt, that it is an ancient Ceremonie, deriued from the Primitiue Church, grounded vpon reaſon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. For what is the ſigne of Chriſt, but the Croſſe of our Sauiour, are not the Sacraments of God, the ſeales of God? wherein we are ſealed and confirmed, by the arrabon and witneſſe of his Spirit? As the doores and threſhold were ſigned with the bloud of the Paſchall Lambe: ſo it is the bloud of Chriſt, our true Paſſouer, that doth ſeale both our hearts, and foreheads; I do not ſay with <hi>Austin, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellit exterminatorem, ſi Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inueniat habitatorem,</hi> Though in his 50. Tract vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> it be twiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, within the ſpace of ſixe lines. Yet let me borrow ſo much from that learned Father, <hi>Nihil olim in carne intolerabilius, nihil modo in fronte glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſius.</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:19972:16"/> Heretofore there was nothing more bloudy, and intollerable to the renting of our fleſh, and the tearing of our bodies: Now there is nothing more glorious, and honourable, to the acknowledgement of faith, and the beautifying of our foreheads. But what meanes the ſeale of my Text? And why is he deſirous to be as a ſignet? Take it actiuely, take it paſſiuely, for the impreſſion that is made, or the ſeale and ring, that maketh the impreſſion, it is diuerſly vſed, and hath many ſingular effects, <hi>Ad cuſtodiam, ad notificationem, ad gratiam, ad confirmationem:</hi> For beautie and exornation, that his glorie may ſhine in vs, for diſtinction and notification, that we might be knowne from ſtrangers, for cuſtodie and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that nothing go in nor out to annoy and hurt vs. For aſſurance and confirmation, that we be not drawne from God, or relinquiſh the truth of our profeſſion. Thus are wee become as an encloſed garden, or a fountaine ſealed vp, like that Eaſtgate in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Sanctuary, which was ſhut and might not be opened, leſt any ſhould enter. Open locks tempt theeues: but that which is ſealed remaines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolate. So if Faith, and Truth, and hope, and ioy, and the graces of the Spirit, and the myſteries of our ſaluation, be not ſealed in Chriſt, they may be ſtolne from our hearts, and become a prey to the enemy. But if they lie vnder this ſeale, they are faſt and ſure: No hereſie, no vanity, no crueltie, nor policie, ſhall be able to rob and ſpoyle vs of our glorie. Well may Satan come in, like a theefe by the windowes, and enter through the paſſages of our ſence: if once he eſpie this ſeale vpon the heart, he will recoyle, and fly backe. It is a ſtrong munition, able to repulſe, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19972:16"/> exterminate all the diuels in hell, though multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and banded in troopes and legions. Now we haue the force of the Originall, and the emphaſis of Septuagint, the one vpon, the other about, he will be vpon our hearts to ſuppreſſe the euill that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to preuent the danger that is without, he will be about the arme, that wee may be enuironed on euery ſide, and ſecured from the inrode of ſpirituall wickedneſſe. Should I diſtinctly proſecute the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues of this ſeale, you might call for a ſeale vnto my lippes: and therefore I labour to be ſhort. Yet is there one meaning of this Embleme, which I may not forget, and that is loue, and honour, with a deare reſpect, and moſt precious eſtimation. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that of <hi>Ieremie, If he were as the ſeale of my right hand, yet would I plucke him thence.</hi> Remember that of <hi>Haggai, I will make him as the ſignet of mine arme, becauſe I haue choſen him:</hi> what doth this ſound, but of grace and fauour? It is the ſeale of our ring, and the image of our friend, whereof we are proud and boaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ventilat aeſtiuum digitis ſudantibus aurum:</hi> Thus will he be as the ſeale of our hand, or as the gemme of our finger, that he may be held more deare and pretious, then thouſands of gold and ſiluer: For what is more ſweete, what more pleaſing, what more glorious, what more honourable, then Chriſt Ieſus? at whoſe beautie, the Sunne and the Moone are abaſhed, on whoſe face the Angels looke with admiration, and aſtoniſhment. His power made vs, the power of his God-head: his weakeneſſe ſaued vs, the weakeneſſe of his manhood. Therefore may he iuſtly ſet his marke vpon vs, yet is it not the rubie,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19972:17"/> or the chryſolite, or the ſaphir, or the diamond, or any other pretious ſtone, that he would ſtocke and graft in vs, but himſelfe, the image of himſelfe, more deare and precious, then all the world beſide. O that we did eſteeme him as a rich pearle, or iewell of great price, and incomparable value, and not onely ſo, but in this imitate <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> put him into our draft, and traiect him into our bowels, with the hunger and thirſt of righteouſneſſe. We know the zeale of that <hi>Theban</hi> Captaine, when being brought into the campe halfe dead, he asked whether his ſhield were taken by the enemie, as if nothing elſe were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and when he found it ſafe, he began to kiſſe it and reuiue againe: Such ought to be our zeale toward Chriſt, the ſhield of our defence, and the ſeale of our redemption. What is the Church but as a garden? What are we but as ſpirituall Bees? O let vs ſucke the flowers, and draw the ſweetneſſe, and neuer reſt, till we haue made a hiue of our ſoules and bodies: that our hearts may be as waxe, ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and mollified, for the impreſſion of this ſeale, and nothing but this, I meane, Chriſt Ieſus and him crucified. The place he chuſeth for himſelfe, is the heart, by faith and confidence: the arme, by loue, and charitable operations: and that as a ſeale, or a ſignet, for eſteeme and dignity. Let me therefore once more beſeech you, that you would all be kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of this ſeale, without which nothing is to bee held: but chiefly the houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Leuie,</hi> whether God hath placed vs, as the ſignet of his arme, iudge you, there is peace within our walls, and plenteouſneſſe within our palaces, we ſit vnder our vines, and our figtrees, and there is none
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19972:17"/> to make vs affraid: our ſonnes grow vp as young plants, and our daughters as the poliſht corners of the Temple: our garners abound; and are full of all manner of ſtore, our ſheepe bring forth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and ten thouſands in our folds: our oxen are ſtrong to labour, and there is no decay, no leading captiue, no complaining in our ſtreets. Thus hath he put vs, as the ſeale of his heart, and as the ſignet of his arme, by the care of his loue, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his affection. Not to do the like with him, and to anſwer loue by loue, were great inhumanity, wonderfull impietie: he doth not ſo with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he rather maketh them as a marke to ſhoote at in the fierceneſſe of his diſpleaſure: but let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget his abundant louing kindneſſe, crying with Saint <hi>Bernard, Sufficit amor Chriſti,</hi> the loue of Chriſt ſufficeth, in him alone we are rich, and haue enough: he is very ſweet and delectable, the reſt of our labour, the ſtay of our pilgrimage, the comfort of our heauines, the pledge of bleſſedneſſe. That as now we are as the ſeale of his left hand, by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fauours: ſo hereafter we may be as the ſeale of his right hand, by his euerlaſting mercies. Which the Lord grant, for the merits of his Sonne, to whom with the Spirit, three perſons, and one God, be honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, power, and maieſtie, this day and for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And therefore I the leſſe maruell what Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes among the Romanes, that when they built temples on to their Images, and deified their ſeuerall

You may compare it to that ſiluer cup, which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> put into the mouth of <hi>Beniamins</hi> ſacke, all the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> returned laden from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with come and money in their ſacks: onely <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> had the cup, as a ſingular pledge of his brothers fauour.

Great was the honour of Chriſt, in regard of his threefold vnction, he was annointed as a Prophet, and ſpake as neuer man did; he was annointed as a Prieſt, and layd the holo cauſt of his bodie vpon the altar of his croſſe: he was annointed as a King, and now ſits regnant on the hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the throne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing receiued all power, both in heauen and earth by donation from the Father. Yea ſaith <hi>Bernard, Pretioſi magis panni ſaluatoris:</hi> The robes of Kings, are not to be compared with the raggs of Chriſt: nor the throne of Princes, with the croſſe of our Sauiour. There is more honour in the nayles of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19972:22"/> his croſſe, then in the pearles of their crownes, that mannage the ſcepters of diuers Nations, and mighty kingdomes. But whether his arme be full of ſtrength, or his lippes be full of grace, or his ſoule be full of knowledge, or his fleſh be full of glorie, the ground is taken from the Prophet, <hi>Quia Deus in eternum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedixit:</hi> Becauſe God hath bleſſed him for euer. <hi>Full of grace are thy lippes, becauſe God hath bleſſed thee for euer.</hi> And therefore let vs beſeech our heauenly Father, as the daughter of <hi>Caleb</hi> did her earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he would giue vnto vs, the ſprings aboue, as well as the ſprings beneath, that <hi>irriguum inferius,</hi> of humane grace, and temporall happineſſe: that <hi>irriguum ſuperius,</hi> of diuine grace, and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe: wreſtling with God as Iacob with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, till he bleſſe vs, and make a vnion of that double character, <hi>Traiano melior, Auguſto foelicior:</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Traian,</hi> with the fortune of <hi>Auguſtus, Non te demittam niſi benedixeris,</hi> I will not let thee go ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou bleſſe me.

                  <p>I know not whether I may vſe the words of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Per calcatum patrem ad vexillum crucis euola,</hi> Let thy children hang about thy necke, and thy wife entreat thee with diſheauilled haire, let thy father lie ſprawling in the way, and thy mother ſhew the breaſts that gaue thee ſucke, tread vpon the wombe that bare thee, bee not mooued with the teares of her that lyeth in thy boſome, flie amayne to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the croſſe, and let nothing hold thee from the kiſſes of thy Sauiour, the ſpitituall embracings of thy ſweeteſt loue Chriſt Ieſus. Perhaps yee will cry with the Diſciples, <hi>Durus eſt hic ſermo,</hi> this is a hard ſaying, and comes neare the apathie of Stoicks.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19972:26"/> Yet God knowes and my conſcience beares me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe how I long for your perfection: that yee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all vertue and godlineſſe of liuing: that yee ride on, hauing your loynes girt like the Sonne of man, whoſe paps were girt with a girdle of gold, that ye prooue, (as it is ſaid of <hi>Iob) Magni inter ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entales,</hi> Great amongſt the inhabitants of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> not the inhabitants of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but the inhabitants of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> what is that? but as the moralizing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth interpret, <hi>interchoros ſuperorum,</hi> among thoſe that ſhine and riſe as the ſtarres of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the light of truth, and the beautie of holines.

                  <p>O my brethren, haue wee not the Church as an arke, or a throne? haue we not Chriſt as a guide or a ruler? haue we not the word of truth, and of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of righteouſneſſe, as a teame to leade and draw vs to euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe?

                  <p>It is not the aduenture, but the motiue, not the danger, but the reaſon that dignifies our actions.

What though we breake the pitchers of our bodies in the painfull conflict of this our ſpirituall warfare? There is no loſſe ſo we keepe our lamps burning, and make the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhine as it were a candle in a darke place: did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſo? and the holy men of old? I could leade you to that noble armie of heauenly Martyrs, that waſh their garments in the bloud of the Lambe, and now ſtand about the throne of God with crownes on their heads and palmes in their hands. Though I know the encounter of my text, is not outward and temporall, but inward and ſpirituall: Yet let mee call to mind one exploit for the word of truth, when theſe generous <hi>Argonauts</hi> were tranſported to the Citie of the great King for the honour of God, and the libertie of his ſeruants. <hi>France, Germanie, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, Italie,</hi> with this our mother Iland ſent forth their ſtrength, and were mooued with zeale towards the houſe of God, and the place of his Sanctuarie. The greateſt Princes and moſt heroicall worthies of

The one as the Court of Iuſtice, the other as the Court of Chancery, that qualifies and mittigates the rigor of the former; yet what is the word of truth, but the word of Chriſt?

If hee that walkt in the midſt of the golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes, had eyes like fire, the head and the haire were as ſnow, or as wooll. It was not wine alone, nor oyle alone, which that good <hi>Samaritane</hi> poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hurt of the wounded, neither was God in the fire, nor in the earthquake, nor in the wind, that brake the rocks and tare the mountaines; but in the ſtill and ſoft voyce which is more powerfull then all the force of <hi>Periclean</hi> lightning, and <hi>Pannicall</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations.

So that is often done, by the mild inſinuation of loue and gentleneſſe, which the bluſtering winds of

Well might the Iewes haue ſpared that ſcarlet robe which they caſt vpon his loynes, for before they had left him, they made ſcarlet of his fleſh, died and dipped in the bloudie torrent of his roſie paſſion.

Where but on the croſſe? when but at the effuſion of his bloud, did hee ſay to that curſed malefactor, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſo,</hi> this day thou ſhalt bee with me in Paradiſe?

For if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall raigne

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19972:56"/> of our fathers, they ſhould neuer enter into his reſt, becauſe they prouoked him in the wildernes: Hee ſaith onely to the generation of their children, they ſhall enter into his reſt: If they obey his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. What is his word, as good as his oath? yes, when he that ſpeaketh is truth it ſelfe, and he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that hath none greater then himſelfe. For his paſſion was our redemption, and if I may vſe the words of <hi>Bernard, Clauus penetrans, clauis aperiens.</hi> The nayles that faſtned him to the croſſe, the ſpeare that ran him through, the lance that opened his ſide, the iron that went into his ſoule, is made a key to vnlocke heauen, and to make vs enter. Therefore do wee ſing triumphantly in the Churches Liturgie, <hi>When thou hadſt ouecome the ſharpneſſe of death, thou didſt open the kingdome of heauen to all beleeuers.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable whereunto is the viſion of Saint <hi>Iohn, I lookt, and behold there was a doore opened in the midst of heauen, and the firſt voice I heard, was as the ſound of a trumpet,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come vp higher.</hi> But if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did not reſt the ſeuenth day, before he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the works of his creation, and found them good. <hi>God ſaw all that was made, &amp; loe it was very good, Gen.</hi> 1. 31. How ſhall we hope to enter his reſt, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sabboth of our bodies, and our ſpirits, before we haue done ſome good, examined our hearts, tried our faith, prooued our workes, and found ſome goodneſſe in the midſt of their imperfections? wee may not pleaſe God without faith, or ſee God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our holineſſe. The bridegroome will paſſe by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice of vs, if wee haue neither faith in our hearts, nor oyle in our veſſels. The oyle of grace, the oyle of mercy, the oyle of deuotion, the oyle of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19972:57"/> charitie, ſhining and burning to the comfort of our brethren. As wiſedome doth not enter the houſe of an euill ſoule: ſo an euill ſoule doth not enter the houſe of wiſedome. Therefore doth he ſtand at the doore and knocke, with an <hi>aperi ſponſa, aperi columba.</hi> Open my loue, open my done.

For except your righteouſneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> yee ſhall neuer enter the kingdome of heauen. Looke vpon thoſe Elders which ſtand before the throne, they are clothed with white robes, and haue palmes in their hands, which is nothing but the flower and beauty of their good workes and Chriſtian pietie. It is ſtoried of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that once a yeare they made a great feaſt, where none may come, but ſuch as haue ſlaine an enemie. The feaſt God makes vs, is the ioy of my Text, a great feaſt, and in the ſimplicitie of termes, exceeding gaudies: but there is no entrance or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, before we haue crucified the body of ſinne; ſlaine an enemie, ſacrificed a rebell, yea many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and many rebels, that fight againſt the ſoule by true confeſſion and heartie repentance, neuer to be repented of. <hi>Adiebus Ioannis Baptiſtae</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Since the time of Iohn Baptiſt, the kingdome of heauen ſuffers violence.</hi> Why ſince the time of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt?</hi> But onely to ſhew the vertue of repentance, becauſe hee taught repentance, and was neuer without a <hi>poenitentiam agite</hi> in his mouth.

Whence is that of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, Rapiamus fletibus, quod non debetur meritis.</hi> Let vs ſnatch that by force of teares, which is not due

                  <p>I know there bee many pretend keyes, and would faine leade vs into a fooles paradiſe, by a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their deceitfull merits: witneſſe that great <hi>Clauiger</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that vſurpeth all power in heauen and earth, as if he alone had the key of <hi>Dauid, That openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> It is not enough for Chriſt to looſe, if hee binde: it is not enough for Chriſt to remit, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: it is not enough for Chriſt to ſay enter, if hee ſay be gone. O the curſed blaſphemie of that open ſepulchre, how doe they ſpoile God of his naturall right and peculiar iuriſdiction? And yet they are not the keyes of heauen, but of hell, which theſe men keepe, <hi>abyſsi claues</hi> (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writes) <hi>the keyes of that bottomleſſe pit,</hi> where they leade many by the hereſie of their doctrine, and the impiety of their actions.

                  <p>It is a pretty ſtory which I read of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> when he was troubled in conſcience, and toucht with the remorſe for his iniquities: his Confeſſor cheared him vp, with a <hi>Quid times, ſancte pater?</hi> Holy father, what makes you affraid?

Woe be vnto you, ye take vnto you the keyes of heauen, but you do not enter your ſelues: and ſuch as come yee forbid, or rather indeed yee bid all that come, at your publike Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as baſe Hucſters of Gods free mercy, in the ſale and market of Pardons and Indulgences. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe men abuſe that power againſt the truth, which is giuen for the truth, we are ſure Chriſt hath left keyes with his Church. <hi>Tibi dabo claues,</hi> was a grant made to the Apoſtles in the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſtands good to euery Miniſter of the Goſpell, vnder the broad ſeale of the Croſſe. <hi>To thee will I giue the keyes of heauen.</hi> They haue all the keyes of heauen, keyes of knowledge, and keyes of power, to inſtruct the ignorant, to abſolue the penitent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, to releaſe puniſhment, to ſhut heauen, by the threatnings of the Law, and the denouncing of vengeance: to open heauen, by the tydings of the Goſpell, &amp; the miniſterie of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Whence is that of <hi>Dauid, Diffuſa eſt gratia in labijs tuis, Full of grace are thy lippes, becauſe God hath bleſſed thee for euer.</hi> The lippes of Chriſt are the Miniſters of his Church, that declare mercy, preſerue knowledge, excite repentance, pronounce forgiueneſſe, and are full of grace indeed, whilſt they ſpeake comfortably to Ieruſalem, ſaying in vertue of their Commiſſion, as Chriſt doth in the fulneſſe of iuriſdiction: <hi>Bee of good cheare, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee:</hi> I abſolue
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19972:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> thee from all thy ſinnes, in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. Ariſe, take vp thy bed and walke, walke towards heauen, get thee vnto Paradiſe: the reſt of thy Sauiour, the ioy of thy Maiſter, which is the nature and qualitie of our profeſſion: now to be examined and diſcuſſed. <hi>Enter into thy maſters ioy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did the Lord ſay, enter the goods or the lands, the houſes or the tenures of thy Lord and maſter, for indeed the earth is the Lords, and all that is therein. How would the greedie Harpyes of this world, flie to get poſſeſſion? Some like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that came downe haſtily: others like the blouddy Farmer of the vineyard in the Goſpell, that ſlue the heire and tooke the inheritance, but many haue theſe things which neuer enioy them. Haue ye not ſeene great ſubſtance, and no ioy? great learning, and no ioy? great victorie, and no ioy? great ſpoyles, and no ioy? Theſe things are often ioynd with feare, and griefe, and iealouſie, and diſtraction, whilſt many cry with the Prophet, <hi>O my leanneſſe, my leanneſſe,</hi> in the midſt of their braueſt triumphs and greateſt ouerflowings. And therefore it is worth the obſeruing, what a great <hi>Sultan</hi> ſpake, when hee beate the Chriſtians with the loſſe of many thouſand ſouldiers. I would be loath to ouercome ſo very often. <hi>Multiplicaſti gentem, ſed non multiplicaſti laetitiam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſay, Thou haſt multiplyed the Nation, but thou hast not multiplyed their ioy.</hi> And bee there not many, of whom we may ſay, <hi>Multiplicaſti the ſaurum, ſed non multiplicaſti laetitiam.</hi> Thou haſt multiplyed their treaſure, but thou haſt not multiplyed their ioy? Thou haſt increaſed their children, but thou haſt not

Howſoeuer God diſpoſe theſe things, as he doth his Sunne and his raine, ſometimes on the good, ſometimes on the bad, without diſtinction: Hee will be ſure to keepe ioy for his ſeruants, if they haue it not in the fleſh, they ſhall haue it in the ſpirit, if they haue it not in life, they ſhall haue it in death, if they haue it not in themſelues, they ſhall haue it in the Lord, <hi>And the bones that are broken ſhall reioyce.</hi> Good reaſon hath Chriſt to bid vs enter his ioy, for ſuch is the incomprehenſible greatneſſe thereof, it may not enter vs. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene it, eare hath not heard it, neither hath it entred into the heart of man.</hi> For the righteous are compaſſed with the goodneſſe of the Lord, and they haue ioy on euery ſide, ioy within, from the puritie of their conſcience, ioy without, from the glory of their bodies, ioy aboue, from the ſight of God, and the fruition of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ioy beneath, from the remembrance of death, and the torments they haue eſcaped: but this ſpeech is figuratiue, and by the ioy of my text, we conceiue the place of ioy, the garden of pleaſure, the Paradiſe of God, the fountaine of liuing waters: where his children do not onely ſucke the breaſts of comfort and milke them out: but drinke and are ſatisfied with the plenty of delight, as from a riuer crying to their ſoules, in the fulneſſe of ſecuritie, as the rich man did in the deceitfulneſſe of vanitie, <hi>Soule, ſoule, liue at eaſe, and take thy paſtime, thou haſt goods layd vp for many yeares:</hi> or rather indeed, for euerlaſting generations. For the Lord hath promiſed to create

If there be any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it, it is but (as <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>miſeriae ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> no degree of ioy, but a ſolace of diſtreſſe, to qualifie and temper the ſower water of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold afflictions.

When <hi>Ionah</hi> was caſt into the ſea, the ſtorme ceaſt, and there was a great calme: when the Lord brought his firſt begotten into the world, the troubles were abated, &amp; there was a great peace throughout the whole earth: <hi>Fluuius pacis</hi> (as <hi>Eſay</hi> writeth) <hi>A floud of peace,</hi> for a ſea of miſery: and that which before was a place of exile and baniſhment, is now the Tabernacle of reſt and quiet: where the Lord hath extended peace, and ſafetie, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,

For as the naturall body is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of contrary elements, ſo diuerſe qualities may perfect the myſticall body of Chriſt Ieſus. And though we do not ſtriue againſt fleſh and bloud, yet do we againſt the Prince of this world, and againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes in the higheſt places: whence is that of <hi>Bernard, Inter Babilonem, &amp; Hieruſalem pax nulla,</hi> betwixt <hi>Babilon</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there is no peace.

But

For it is peace that is our inheritance on the earth, and that which followes her immoueable center, as motion, heauen is the tranquillity of reſt &amp; holines. Though Chriſt might haue promiſed many things to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and giuen them power ouer kingdomes and nations, as well as ouer ſerpents, and ſcorpions, yet all that hee ſayes vnto them, is <hi>In me pacem habituri,</hi>

Seeke this peace, loue this peace, pray for this peace, long for this peace, &amp; keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace: that as Chriſt is knit to vs, in the vnitie of perſon, we may be knit to him in the vnitie of profeſſion.
